Javascript Photo Gallery
Generated at:  http://www.creatingonline.com/webmaster/generators/photo_gallery_generator.htm

INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  Copy and paste the code generated for you into any blank web page editor (in HTML view) or any text editor (such as Notepad or Wordpad).
2.  Create a new folder in your website directory called "images", if you don't already have one.  Upload all of your full-sized photos into this directory.
3.  Edit the gallery code to replace "pic.jpg" with your image file names. For each image in your gallery, the name will appear twice in the code, once as "images/pic.jpg" and then a second time on the next line as just "pic.jpg." When editing the code to add your own image file names, be sure to do so on both lines for each photo. 
4.  Upload the background image file for the style you selected to the same directory as your gallery.
5.  Upload the style.css file for the style you selected to the same directory as your gallery.
6.  Then just publish your website as you usually do.
